<h3 align="center">Senior Frontend Engineer</h3>

I am a Front-end Technical Lead with experience across diverse domains, including digital healthcare, SEO CMS, e-commerce, and CRM solutions. My expertise lies in web and native application development using React and React Native. I hold two Master's degrees, in Computer Science and in Organisation of Wholesale and Retail Trade, that provide me with a strong foundation in both technical and business aspects of software development.

I began my development career as a backend developer in 2007. From there, I made significant progress, transitioning to roles such as senior backend developer, back-end team lead, lead front-end developer and eventually becoming a front-end technical lead. Throughout my journey, I worked with prominent companies like Ciklum, Agnitio, and Maguru.

To help new graduates in Ukraine kickstart their careers in the IT industry, I established a front-end community providing guidance and support to secure their first job. I also mentored several junior developers and helped them grow into senior roles.

Currently, I live in Portugal, with my wife, and I am looking for a new opportunity to join a product company. I have an exceptional reference record from all my previous employers and colleagues.

I am interested in working with cutting-edge technologies in product companies.
